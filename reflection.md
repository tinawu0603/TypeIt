## Why TypeIt!
When the time comes for me to decide what I want to do for my first unessay, I was torn between several ideas. I knew I wanted to do a programming related project because it's a topic I enjoy diving into and I want to use this opportunity to learn something new. I considered coding a website from scratch and perhaps write about some topics that really interested me throughout the semester so far. I thought about making a simple cryptography program that encrypts the input file and successfully decrypts it back. Then there's this Chrome Extension idea, to allow users to change external aspects of a webpage based on their preferences.

I finally decided on this TypeIt! project because I remember feeling so fascinated and intrigued during the discussion in class when everyone spoke about their favorite fonts and the reasoning behind them. I would never consider myself an artsy person, never had an eye for design, formatting, color palettes, etc. But when my classmates stumbled over trying to explain why they like a certain font, concluding to "it just feels right and easy for me to read", I understood. A huge part of design, specifically web design, ultimately lies in the user's experience. In the article [*"How Does Color Usage Affect Search Engine Optimization and Conversions"*](https://searchengineland.com/how-color-affects-search-engine-optimization-seo-138393), Shari Thurow discussed the importance of a user-centric interface and the effects of color contrasts on a webpage to the reader. I became even more intrigued to dive into this project to better readers' experiences.

I remember reading M.M. Backus's [*"Novel Writers and Publishers"*](http://www.merrycoz.org/books/PARLOR.xhtml) and struggling to stay focus and follow the lines. I remember reading other articles and websites and wished the font was different, wished the background color wasn't just plain white, and wished I could change something about the page. After the unit on Typecasting and reading Chris Gayomali's [*"How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think"*](http://theweek.com/articles/463196/how-typeface-influences-way-read-think), it really made me realize how much typography affects the reader.

## Struggles and Learning Curve
I was very nervous about this project and felt uncertain that I will be able to finish it. I've never built a Chrome Extension before so I wasn't sure how long it will take and how difficult the whole process will be. But then I remember Professor Cordell's encouragement that he'd rather us try and attempt something bold than to choose the easy option. So I began my research online on how to get this project started.

I felt intimidated. Everything felt so foreign. I started reading Google's [Developer's Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) and downloaded a few files as starter code. Trying to understand the code was extremely difficult because I've never done JavaScript coding before, and it reminded me of the time when I was learning French and how I only recognize a few words. I began to reflect a little bit about language and the importance of coherence. I understood some of the lines individually in JavaScript because of my proficiency in Java. Similarly, I recognized some vocabulary in French because of my proficiency in English. However, understanding the entire context require more effort.

I started by learning the purpose of every function, jotting down comments and annotating the code. I was reading like a [Renaissance Reader](http://www.adamghooks.net/2012/08/how-to-read-like-renaissance-reader.html) - "To read and not to understand what we read, or not to know how to make use of it, is nothing else but a neglect of all good learning." It could not have been more suited in this context. If I didn't understand what the snippets of code does, how can I utilize the specific function to accomplish my objective? So I gathered up all my patience and began decoding the starter code.

## Instant Gratification
When I completed my analysis of the starter code, I began working towards my first goal - changing the background color. Of course, like a lot of programming, it requires googling and trial-and-error. But when the background color of that page smoothly changed to the color I selected, I cheered and did an inner fist bump in my head. This is the feeling that keeps me addicted to programming: the satisfaction and sense of achievement that resulted from solving problems and overcoming challenges. I was giddy and riding what my friends and I like to call the "coder's rush". I selected a lot of different background colors, some oohs and aahs when the colors were pretty and comfortable, but I frowned when the colors were sharp and hurt my eyes. I feel myself slowly entering the design zone.

With this baby step accomplished, I took the next step and started integrating font changes. This was definitely the most interesting part during the development. I looked at so many fonts and added the most popular and web-safe ones to the selection list. As always, I played around with all the different fonts and just sat there with a smile on my face while experiencing the different appeals the fonts exuded. The nerdy composer in me actually laughed because of how easy it is to click a different font in a dropdown menu compared to how laborious it is to remove all the type and re-compose with a different case in order to change the font.

I got into the rhythm of implementing new functionalities.
1. Add a section for the new functionality to popup.html so it shows when the user clicks on the extension
2. Add the components needed for the functionality to popup.html
  1. color chooser for changing background colors
  2. dropdown menu for changing fonts
3. Add the JavaScript function for the specific action, and include the script needed to change aspects of the webpage
  1. script to change fontFamily for changing fonts
4. Add the JavaScript EventListener so the program knows when the user has interacted with the extension (clicked a button, selected a dropdown menu item)

Like letterpress printing, it was a process all the same. When our type wasn't printing clearly on the letterpress machine, we adapt, problem-solve, and try again. When a functionality wasn't working the way it should, I analyze, debug, and try again.
