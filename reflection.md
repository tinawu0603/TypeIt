## Why TypeIt!
When the time comes for me to decide what I want to do for my first unessay, I was torn between several ideas. I knew I wanted to do a programming related project because it's a topic I enjoy diving into and I want to use this opportunity to learn something new. I considered coding a website from scratch and perhaps write about some topics that really interested me throughout the semester so far. I thought about making a simple cryptography program that encrypts the input file and successfully decrypts it back. Then there's this Chrome Extension idea, to allow users to change external aspects of a webpage based on their preferences.

I finally decided on this TypeIt! project because I remember feeling so fascinated and intrigued during the discussion in class when everyone spoke about their favorite fonts and the reasoning behind them. I would never consider myself an artsy person, never had an eye for design, formatting, color palettes, etc. But when my classmates stumbled over trying to explain why they like a certain font, concluding to "it just feels right and easy for me to read", I understood. A huge part of design, specifically web design, ultimately lies in the user's experience. In the article ["How Does Color Usage Affect Search Engine Optimization and Conversions"](https://searchengineland.com/how-color-affects-search-engine-optimization-seo-138393), Shari Thurow discussed the importance of a user-centric interface and the effects of color contrasts on a webpage to the reader. I became even more intrigued to dive into this project to better readers' experiences.

I remember reading M.M. Backus's [*"Novel Writers and Publishers"*](http://www.merrycoz.org/books/PARLOR.xhtml) and struggling to stay focus and follow the lines. I remember reading other articles and websites and wished the font was different, wished the background color wasn't just plain white, and wished I could change something about the page. After the unit on Typecasting and reading Chris Gayomali's [*"How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think"*](http://theweek.com/articles/463196/how-typeface-influences-way-read-think), it really made me realize how much typography affects the reader.

## Struggles and Learning Curve
I was very nervous about this project and uncertained that I will be able to finish it. I've never built a Chrome Extension before so I wasn't sure how long it will take and how difficult the whole process will be.
